        training:
          dos:
            moderate:
              - "Set clear targets for every drill and keep simple scores so your competitive side stays interested without feeling like a grind."
              - "Include some light pressure games (e.g., \"hit 5 of 8 fairways\") so you practice committing to a target, not just hitting balls."
            high:
              - "Build every session around aggressive, measurable goals—timed challenges, score-to-beat games, and stats you track from week to week."
              - "Use short, intense blocks (15–20 minutes) where you must \"win\" the drill (e.g., hit a target zone, complete an up‑and‑down run) before you move on."
            extreme:
              - "Turn practice into a series of high‑stakes contests: give yourself bold targets, tight margins, and consequences for missing so you feel like you're in a match, not a warm‑up."
              - "Channel your need to dominate by attacking your biggest scoring leaks—set aggressive improvement targets and compete hard against your own numbers."
          donts:
            moderate:
              - "Drift through practice without clear goals; if you're just \"hitting a few,\" you'll lose focus quickly."
              - "Ignore fundamentals just because they feel slow—your scoring instincts still need a solid base."
            high:
              - "Mindlessly beat balls without a target or score; that kills your edge and wastes your intensity."
              - "Constantly chase more power or new swing ideas while neglecting your wedges and putting—you win most strokes there."
            extreme:
              - "Turn every session into a reckless power contest; when you smash without a plan, you train bad habits at high speed."
              - "Abandon a good improvement plan the moment results are slow—you're wired to push, but your game needs disciplined follow‑through, not constant reinvention."
        playing:
          dos:
            moderate:
              - "Before the round, pick a few holes where you'll be more aggressive and a few where \"par is a win,\" so you don't decide everything on the tee."
              - "When you stand over the ball, give yourself one clear, confident intention instead of debating options."
            high:
              - "Build a simple attack plan: know which holes you're going to drive hard, which you'll play for position, and commit fully when it's time to pull the trigger."
              - "Use a fast, uncluttered routine and one bold swing cue (e.g., \"start it at that bunker and hammer it\") to match your natural decisiveness."
            extreme:
              - "Treat each hole like a mission: decide quickly whether you're going for maximum reward or smart containment, then execute with total commitment."
              - "Use your intensity to stay locked into the present shot—channel all that fire into a clear target and a fearless swing instead of arguing with past swings."
          donts:
            moderate:
              - "Overthink simple shots; once you've picked a target and club, stop re‑checking and swing."
              - "Play timidly when the situation clearly favors you taking on a bit more—your game can handle a controlled attack."
            high:
              - "Fire at every flag just because you can; avoid low‑percentage hero shots when the middle of the green keeps you in scoring position."
              - "Let one bad hole turn into three—have a clear reset (deep breath, smart fairway‑finder, safe target) to break any \"revenge\" spiral."
            extreme:
              - "Turn the round into a personal war with the course or playing partners—rage leads straight to reckless, card‑wrecking decisions."
              - "Launch at tucked pins or risky carries just to prove a point; if the odds aren't with you, your most ruthless move is choosing the smart play."
      I:
        training:
          dos:
            moderate:
              - "Add some variety and small games into practice so it stays interesting without becoming chaotic."
              - "Use a few simple feel cues (like \"smooth and flowing\") to keep your swing athletic rather than overly technical."
            high:
              - "Turn practice into games—up‑and‑down contests, \"HORSE\" with wedges, and shot‑shaping challenges—to keep your creativity fully engaged."
              - "Practice with others or make it social when you can; your energy and focus rise when there's interaction and fun."
            extreme:
              - "Treat every session like a mini event: fun, competitive games, bold shot shapes, and plenty of variety so your attention never goes flat."
              - "Lean hard into feel—experiment with curves, trajectories, and lies so you can trust your artistry instead of living in mechanics."
          donts:
            moderate:
              - "Let practice become the same boring drill over and over; a bit of boredom quickly turns into distraction for you."
              - "Drown yourself in complex swing theory—keep it to one or two simple technical priorities at a time."
            high:
              - "Grind alone for hours on dry, technical work with no variety—you'll lose interest and start going through the motions."
              - "Let constant chatting, phone use, or side conversations eat your entire session; set short focused blocks, then take social breaks."
            extreme:
              - "Pretend you can white‑knuckle your way through long, technical practices; when you're bored, quality plummets. Design sessions that stay entertaining."
              - "Skip structured improvement just because you feel \"on\" that day—your talent shines brightest when it's backed by some disciplined work."
        playing:
          dos:
            moderate:
              - "Keep your mood light and use a calm, positive phrase (\"smooth and easy,\" \"swing free\") to stay loose over the ball."
              - "Choose one simple feel thought for the round and stick with it so your mind doesn't chase a new idea every few holes."
            high:
              - "Walk with bounce, smile, and chat—you swing your best when the round feels enjoyable and relaxed."
              - "Trust your natural shot‑making instincts and let your body respond to the picture you see rather than over‑coaching yourself mid‑swing."
            extreme:
              - "Use your charisma to keep the entire group's energy high, but flip an internal switch to \"focus mode\" for the 20–30 seconds you're playing your shot."
              - "Paint a vivid mental picture of each shot—trajectory, landing spot, and feel—then swing to match that picture without second‑guessing."
          donts:
            moderate:
              - "Let one bad shot ruin your vibe; give yourself a quick reset phrase and move on."
              - "Crowd your head with mechanical details—you only need a light reminder, not a full lesson, on the course."
            high:
              - "Chase highlight‑reel shots just because you're excited; under pressure, favor the shot you can pull off 8 times out of 10."
              - "Speed up your routine when you get nervous or fired up—protect your normal pace so your rhythm doesn't disappear."
            extreme:
              - "Let your emotions swing wildly with every shot—if you ride the high too high and the low too low, your decision‑making suffers."
              - "Get so wrapped up entertaining the group or telling stories that you forget to fully go through your pre‑shot routine."
      S:
        training:
          dos:
            moderate:
              - "Keep a generally consistent practice schedule and routine so your swing has something familiar to come back to."
              - "Work on one change at a time and give it enough repetitions for your body to get used to it."
            high:
              - "Build and protect a reliable practice routine—same order, similar structure—so your confidence grows from repetition."
              - "Focus on tempo and rhythm drills that reinforce your natural smooth swing and help it hold up under pressure."
            extreme:
              - "Treat your routine and tempo as sacred—create very predictable practice habits that calm your mind and let your body repeat."
              - "Make tiny, gradual adjustments and stick with them; you thrive when changes are introduced slowly and reinforced patiently."
          donts:
            moderate:
              - "Rush through practice or jump between multiple changes; that's when your rhythm starts to unravel."
              - "Practice exhausted or highly distracted—your style needs quality, not volume."
            high:
              - "Let others talk you into constant swing overhauls; protect your process and make small refinements instead of big rebuilds."
              - "Allow yourself to be rushed on the range—if someone's pace pushes you faster than your comfort, slow yourself down."
            extreme:
              - "Bounce to every new tip or piece of advice you hear; constant tinkering destroys the consistency you value."
              - "Avoid all forms of pressure practice—add gentle, simple challenges so you learn to keep your calm rhythm even when something's on the line."
        playing:
          dos:
            moderate:
              - "Stick to a simple, repeatable pre‑shot routine so you feel settled before each swing."
              - "Choose targets that fit your comfort level and lean into steady, predictable shots over flashy ones."
            high:
              - "Commit to one steady routine for the full round—same breaths, same number of practice swings, same pace—to anchor your rhythm."
              - "Embrace your steady, fairway‑and‑green game and treat pars as wins; your patience is a scoring weapon."
            extreme:
              - "Let your tempo be your identity: no matter what happens, protect that smooth rhythm like it's your superpower."
              - "Aim for smart, safe targets, and trust that your consistency will quietly beat more volatile players over 18 holes."
          donts:
            moderate:
              - "Let faster or slower playing partners drag you out of your natural pace."
              - "Take on wild recovery shots that force you into a swing you don't trust."
            high:
              - "Get frustrated trying to match more aggressive players—play your own steady game."
              - "Abandon your routine when you're in trouble; you need it even more on recovery shots."
            extreme:
              - "Rush your process just because the group or course feels fast—walk briskly if needed, but keep your pre‑shot routine intact."
              - "Carry frustration silently from hole to hole; build a small reset ritual (breath, look up, club back in bag) to let each shot go."
      C:
        training:
          dos:
            moderate:
              - "Give each session one or two clear objectives and a simple way to check if you improved."
              - "Use basic stats or notes (e.g., how many inside a target zone) to guide what you work on next time."
            high:
              - "Track your performance with stats and, when possible, video: fairways, greens, up‑and‑downs, and putting. Let the numbers tell you where to focus."
              - "Break practice into focused, measurable drills with clear success criteria (e.g., 20 chips, record how many finish inside a 3‑foot circle)."
            extreme:
              - "Design very specific, data‑rich practice plans: exact reps, target zones, benchmarks, and review points so you always know where you stand."
              - "Use detailed analysis to target your biggest scoring leaks and build highly structured drills to close those gaps."
          donts:
            moderate:
              - "Show up without any plan at all; even a simple focus keeps you from random, low‑value practice."
              - "Tinker with too many mechanical pieces at once—pick one priority and stay with it."
            high:
              - "Get trapped in analysis paralysis—once you've defined today's focus, spend most of the time hitting shots, not re‑designing the plan."
              - "Practice without measurable objectives; your mind needs clear feedback to stay engaged."
            extreme:
              - "Obsess over every frame of video or every micro‑stat to the point you barely swing; your body needs reps, not just reports."
              - "Constantly redesign your training plan mid‑session; commit to a plan, execute it, then adjust based on data later."
        playing:
          dos:
            moderate:
              - "Have a basic strategy for each hole: safe side of fairway, good miss, and a preferred layup distance when needed."
              - "Pick one simple swing checkpoint (like balance or alignment) and let that be your on‑course anchor."
            high:
              - "Arrive with a clear hole‑by‑hole game plan—clubs from each tee, safe miss areas, and smart layup spots."
              - "Limit yourself to one or two clear thoughts before each shot so your mind stays sharp but not overloaded."
            extreme:
              - "Treat the course like a problem to be solved: use your prep, yardages, and tendencies to script the smartest possible route around."
              - "Once you've done your analysis, shift into \"execute\" mode—trust that your planning handled the details."
          donts:
            moderate:
              - "Re‑engineer your entire swing because of one miss—stay with your main priority."
              - "Stand over the ball trying to think through five different checkpoints."
            high:
              - "Re‑evaluate your whole game plan after a couple of bad outcomes; focus on better execution, not constant redesign."
              - "Freeze over the ball processing too much information—once you've chosen the shot, swing with trust."
            extreme:
              - "Let fear of making a \"wrong\" decision keep you from pulling the trigger—you'll never have perfect certainty on the course."
              - "Chase technical corrections mid‑round; save the deep analysis for after the round and play with what you brought today."
